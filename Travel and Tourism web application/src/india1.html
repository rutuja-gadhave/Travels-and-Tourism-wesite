Taj Mahal Tours
Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and certainly one of India’s most famous landmarks, the Taj Mahal is a living testament to the grandiose and the romantic. Lovingly built from white marble by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, the structure is decorated with carvings of flowers and inlays of precious stone arranged into intricate patterns that can be admired both from its impressive exterior and interior. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a must-see for every traveler to northern India.

The Basics
Tours are available year-round and at all times of the day, and can be customized to your interests and the timing of your visit. The easiest and most popular option for travelers wanting to see the Taj Mahal is to visit on a full-day group tour or in a private car with an English-speaking tour guide and driver, plus roundtrip transportation. Guided tours from both Jaipur and New Delhi abound and often also visit other interesting sights and attractions around Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, such as Agra Fort, the Red Fort, Akbar’s Tomb at Sikandra, and Fatehpur Sikri. Guided photography tours are a popular option at the Tah Mahal and generally take place either at sunset or sunrise. Other excursions, known as Golden Triangle tours, visit Jaipur, New Delhi, and Agra all in one go.
