My absolute favorite city in all of Japan is Kyoto which is the cultural heart of Japan. Kyoto is one of the best cities to visit in Japan. You could spend weeks and even months here without being able to see all the temples and shrines that can be found here.
My favorite place is Arashiyama, in the north-west of Kyoto. This little jewel surrounded by mountains is a great destination any time of the year, but definitely a highlight in November and December when the leaves change color. The gardens and parks are then turned from green to bright reds and yellows and you can be astounded by the beauty of nature.
You should definitely try matcha green tea and dished made of matcha because Kyoto is famous for having delicious matcha. Other sweets you should try are Yatsuhashi. These triangle-shaped sweets made from rice flour and some sweet bean paste are the perfect gifts from Kyoto. But be careful they are only good for about one week.
Kyoto (??) was the capital of Japan for over a millennium, and carries a reputation as its most beautiful city. However, visitors may be surprised by how much work they will have to do to see Kyoto's beautiful side. Most first impressions of the city will be of the urban sprawl of central Kyoto, around the ultra-modern glass-and-steel train station, which is itself an example of a city steeped in tradition colliding with the modern world. 
Nonetheless, the persistent visitor will soon discover Kyoto's hidden beauty in the temples and parks which ring the city center, and find that the city has much more to offer than immediately meets the eye.
