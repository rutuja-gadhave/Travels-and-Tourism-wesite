 Goa is a perfect heaven for the ones who need and want relaxation. 
Goa is one of India's special places, a State seemingly blessed with fabulous weather, even more fabulous beaches, delightful people, good food, hill-top forts, little white-washed churches, soaring Portuguese-era cathedrals, a unique cultural legacy-small wonder, therefore, that Goa is one of India's prime holiday destinations. 
Goa is packed with jaded yuppies hoping to switch off and unwind for a few days, and sun-starved Europeans, soaking up all that glorious sun and food. 
The beaches in Goa, like the others along the Konkan coast, are long, and straight, and fringed with palm trees, but unlike much of the neighboring coastline, Goa has an impressive infrastructure of hotels and beach resorts, restaurants and bars, which cater to all price ranges, from top-notch 5-star luxury, to hippy flop-shops. 
Goa, one of India's smallest states with an area of 3,702 sq km is cradled in the Sahayadri range in the Western Ghats. The vertical strip of the state begins from Tiracol in the north to Palolem in the south and is bounded by the Arabian Sea on the west, Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south. Goa is India's most superior beach resort with superb beaches at least a million years old. Goa's beachnik lifestyle is best experienced during the winter months between October and the end of February. 
A Portuguese colony till 1961, Goa's Portuguese atmosphere and its lovely beaches make this an interesting region to spend time. Goan culture is a blend of Indian and Iberian, European style central squares and Indian bazaars, white Portuguese churches alongside Hindu temples and villages and hamlets surrounded by green fields of paddy. 
Goa is rich in folk culture with a delightful blend of vigorous Konkani folk songs and remnants of Portuguese dance and music. Panaji, Margao, Vasco, Mapusa and Ponda are the main towns of Goa.
